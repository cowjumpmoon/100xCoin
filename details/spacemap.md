## April 2021 - Lay the Foundation üèó

This month is filled with activities that create a solid base for our future growth plans.

**Tech**

* [x] Launch New Smart Contract 
* [x] Refresh 100xCoin Website

**Marketing**

* [x] List on CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, Blockfolio, and Coinbase
* [x] Two Major Exchange Listings - BKEX and Probit
* [x] Sign Professional Athletes to 100xCoin Brand.
* [x] Gain 30,000 Holders

We were successful in achieving these strategic objectives in a short time period preparing us for our next phase of growth. 

## May 2021 - Light the Engines üî•

This month we will announce our first use-cases and start delivering on initial feature sets. For each use case, an additional roadmap page will hosted in the coming days. 

**Tech**

To experiment and iterate on feature sets quickly, we are building **100xLabs,** a defi experimental playground on the Binance Smart Chain. The lab will work with top developers across the world in order to develop highly engaging applications for degens and professional traders. 

A summary of our technology roadmap is below. 

* [x] Announce Use Case I - _**100xCollabos -**_ [NFT Staking, the first athlete and celebrity endorsed NFTs on the Binance Smart Chain](https://www.100xcoin.io/nfts)
* [x] Announce Use Case II - _**100xAltBase -**_ Mobile app dedicated to making the BSC accessible by purchasing 100x from Visa, MasterCard, Apple Pay, SWIFT, SEPA and more. No more "Which Pancake". We will put 100x in the hands of millions of users across the world. Think Robinhood for altcoins. 
* [x] Announce Use Case III - _**100xRocket-**_ ****Crypto Capital Launchpad. This bull run has created many new angel investors, including 100x Holders. Those who hold high amounts of 100xCoin \(Tiered System\) will be able to participate in private pre-sales. Deals will then open to smaller tiers of 100x holders until pre-sales are closed. 
* [x] 100xLabs Releases \(%'s as of the time of this writing\):

  * [ ] _**100xCollabos V1 \(49% complete\)**_
  * [x] _**100xAltbase Demo \(70% complete\)**_

  _\*\*\*\*_

All of our releases work in collaboration with each other. For example our mobile platform will introduce new buyers into the BSC. Whereas most early defi plays have to wait for many weeks to be listed in TrustWallet or on an Exchange, we will give early access to projects with extremely low marketcaps. Top moonshot founders will work with us to be listed on our mobile platform. We already have inquiries from several founders that have mooned projects this bull run. 

**Marketing**

* [ ] 10 AMA's with other projects in the BSC.
* [x] Sponsor first professional sporting event. 
* [x] Merchandise launch.
